## Coronow

Small django project to get the hang of Django3.

It's basically a digital anouncements board that shows which measures are in force in certain regions. 
I got the idea to make this out of personal frustation that you have to consult news sites to find out which measures are in force. And most of them would be behind a paywall...

We live in a digital age. Make one source of truth. How hard can it be, right?

Still a work in progress, tho.
